As you saw in the first lecture this week, we handle the input and output of data from files in Java
+with I/O streams. In this exercise, you are going to use both an input and an output stream to
perform some basic processing on each of the line’s in a file.
+Create a new file in your data folder. This file should be a text file, containing several lines of text.
